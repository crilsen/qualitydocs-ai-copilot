# Requirements

Product requirements describe what to build and why. PRDs are the source of truth for scope; agents treat them as requirements, not suggestions. Keep this file as a short index and store full PRDs under `docs/prd/`.

## Rules

- One PRD per feature or initiative, stored as `docs/prd/NNN-<slug>.md`.
- Status lifecycle: `Draft → Approved → Implemented → Superseded`.
- Only an **Approved** PRD drives implementation; use `.ai/workflows/feature.md`.
- Acceptance criteria must be concrete and testable, and validation maps back to them.
- Do not duplicate requirements here; link to the PRD.
- Record technical choices that a PRD depends on as ADR/TDR entries in `.ai/DECISIONS.md`.
- For large or risky work, a PRD can feed an optional spec-driven flow (`.ai/SPECS.md`, `docs/spec/`) that produces design, plan, and tasks before implementation.
